# 🔊 VOICE FIX - INSTALL pyttsx3!

## 🎯 THE SOLUTION:

Thanks to Gemini's suggestion, we're now using **pyttsx3** instead of PowerShell!

**Why this is better:**
- ✅ Pure Python (no subprocess issues!)
- ✅ Blocking speech (ensures completion)
- ✅ More reliable
- ✅ Cross-platform
- ✅ Better control

---

## 📦 INSTALLATION (ONE COMMAND):

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```

**That's it!** 🎉

---

## 🧪 TEST IT:

```bash
cd C:\Users\jimpames\Desktop\myzork

# Test voice module
python voice_synth.py

# Test the game with voice
python run_game_rpg.py
```

---

## 🎮 IT SHOULD NOW SPEAK!

When you run `python run_game_rpg.py`:

1. **At startup:**
   - "Welcome to ZORK RPG!" 🔊
   
2. **Room descriptions:**
   - "You stand in a grand entrance hall..." 🔊
   
3. **Combat:**
   - "You attack the troll for 25 damage!" 🔊
   - Troll speaks in SLOW, DEEP voice! 🔊

---

## 🔧 IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK:

### **Windows Users:**

If you get an error about `pywin32`, install it:

```bash
pip install pywin32
```

### **Check Installation:**

```bash
pip show pyttsx3
```

Should show version 2.90 or higher.

---

## 💡 HOW IT WORKS NOW:

### **Old Way (PowerShell):**
```python
# Spawned PowerShell process
# Process might exit before speech completes ❌
subprocess.Popen(['powershell', '-Command', '...'])
```

### **New Way (pyttsx3):**
```python
# Pure Python, blocking
# Guarantees speech completes ✅
engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say(text)
engine.runAndWait()  # BLOCKS until done!
```

## 🎯 VOICE PROFILES:

The game uses different voices for different entities:

| Entity | Speed | Volume | Description |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Narrator** | 150 wpm | 80% | Normal, clear |
| **Troll** | 110 wpm | 100% | Slow, menacing |
| **Goblin** | 200 wpm | 80% | Fast, frantic |
| **Dragon** | 100 wpm | 100% | Epic, booming |
| **Merchant** | 160 wpm | 85% | Friendly |

---

## 🚀 QUICK START:

```bash
# 1. Install pyttsx3
pip install pyttsx3

# 2. Test voices
python voice_synth.py

# 3. Play game with voice!
python run_game_rpg.py

# 4. Listen to the adventure! 🎮🔊
```

## ✅ VERIFICATION:

Run this to verify everything works:

```bash
python debug_voice.py
```

This will:
1. Import voice module ✅
2. Create synthesizer ✅
3. Test direct speech ✅
4. Load game engine ✅
5. Test game integration ✅

You should hear voices at steps 3, 5, and 6!
